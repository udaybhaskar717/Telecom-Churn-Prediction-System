### **1. Business Problem**
Customer churn is a critical concern for businesses, especially in subscription-based industries like telecommunications, banking, and SaaS platforms. Churn occurs when customers stop using a companyâ€™s products or services. Retaining existing customers is far more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

#### **Objective**
The goal of this project is to predict customer churn based on customer behavior data. By identifying customers likely to churn, businesses can take proactive measures to retain them, such as offering discounts or personalized services.
